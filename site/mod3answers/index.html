                            House music is generally characterized by a “four-on-the-floor” kick drum beat,
                             a heavy emphasis on off-beat percussion, and a synthesized bass line.
                              While it developed in Chicago’s underground scene in the ’80s, 
                              today, it’s undoubtedly the most popular genre within EDM. 
                              You’ll hear that 128 BPM thump at nearly any party or club. And it will suck you in,
                            so don’t fight it. There is no genre so naturally and purely infectious.
                               To quote G-house juggernaut Malaa, “House music is a healer when you don’t feel good inside …
                                and can’t nobody steal your joy on the dance floor once the music takes over.”

                            Trance is a genre that evolved out of house and techno, mainly in Germany in the ’90s.
                             Like many electronic music genres, trance has a four-on-the-floor beat, although it’s often faster, and has much less emphasis on extra percussion.
                              Trance is a genre to get lost in – its repeating, thumping phrases have the notorious ability to steal souls (at least for a few hours). 
                              It does this with dramatic buildups, gorgeous vocals, and euphoric drops.
                               But like any other genre, it has a myriad of subgenres. Psytrance,
                                for instance, ensnares the listener in a dark hypnosis with its rapid, pounding bass lines.

                            Dubstep emerged from London’s garage scene in the ’90s, although today’s dubstep sounds nothing like its roots.
                             Unlike house or trance, the genre has a distinctive two-step rhythm, often around 70 BPM (or 140 BPM, people get in fights about which one it is).
                              It’s that slow, heavy “BOOM … CHA … BOOM … CHA.” On top of that, it has extraordinarily energetic and aggressive bass lines.
                               One could compare these sounds to demon growls, a blender full of pennies, or an alien apocalypse in a Michael Bay Transformers film.
                                But when you put all that together, it achieves an irresistible energy. You’ll have no choice but to head-bang along.
                                 Just some advice from prior experiences: don’t play dubstep for your mom, she probably won’t like it.
